**Answer:** Clarify tenants, workload/scale, latency/quality SLO, data class/residency, RPO/RTO, deployment modes, team and budget. Relevant facts: is part of Logging; learn its precise definition, mechanism and lifecycle, nearest alternatives, configuration interface, failure/limit, security boundary, observable evidence and production trade-off. turns runtime state into evidence; define signal semantics, labels/context, retention/privacy/cost, healthy baseline, actionable threshold and a query that distinguishes competing hypotheses. is part of Logging; learn its precise definition, mechanism and lifecycle, nearest alternatives, configuration interface, failure/limit, security boundary, observable evidence and production trade-off. Separate control/data planes and failure domains; define identity/trust and encryption/key lifecycle; quantify capacity/headroom/cold path; use immutable delivery/canary/rollback; instrument SLO, saturation, audit and unit cost. Compare managed/shared/dedicated options and include migration, DR test and exit triggers.

## Senior — procedural incident, migration and ownership questions

### LOGGING-SP-01

- [ ] **Incident/migration:** **Question:** You own a high-severity failure or migration involving Structured logs. How do you lead it end to end?

**Answer:** Establish incident/change command, impact, decision rights, communications cadence and abort criteria. Preserve evidence and use `curl -s http://SERVICE/metrics` as one read-only checkpoint, not the whole diagnosis. turns runtime state into evidence; define signal semantics, labels/context, retention/privacy/cost, healthy baseline, actionable threshold and a query that distinguishes competing hypotheses. Choose reversible containment, protect tenant/data boundaries, and keep rollback artifacts/state. Recover in waves and validate SLO, correctness/quality, security and billing. Publish timeline/trade-off/ADR or postmortem, assign preventive actions with owners, and verify them in a game day or migration rehearsal.

## Self-grading

A complete spoken answer names the mechanism, scope/assumptions, one concrete command or configuration field, a failure mode, security/recovery, an SLI and a cost/trade-off. For procedural answers, explicitly separate immediate reversible mitigation from durable source-of-truth repair.
