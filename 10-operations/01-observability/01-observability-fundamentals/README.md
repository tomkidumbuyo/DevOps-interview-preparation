## Explanation

### What it is and why it exists

**Observability fundamentals** is easiest to understand as one part of a larger path. The subject closes the loop between a user outcome and engineering action. Telemetry describes behavior, objectives define acceptable behavior, alerts identify urgent risk, and responders mitigate and repair the source of truth.

The chapter focuses on Metrics, Logs, Traces, Events. These are connected mechanisms, not vocabulary to memorize. Observability fundamentals is the part of Observability that connects the listed mechanisms to effective runtime state, observable behavior and production outcomes The explanations below first build the simple model, then add the exact system behavior and production consequences.

### History and evolution

Production operations moved from checking individual hosts to measuring distributed user journeys. SRE formalized service levels, error budgets and engineering approaches to toil; observability, incident command, post-incident learning and policy-as-code extended that model across cloud platforms.

In this chapter, **Observability fundamentals** is the next layer of that evolution. Its modern purpose is to observability fundamentals is the part of Observability that connects the listed mechanisms to effective runtime state, observable behavior and production outcomes. The exact product surface may change by version, but the underlying state, request path and failure boundaries remain the durable ideas to learn.

### How it works: the end-to-end path

  A["user journey"] --> B["telemetry and objective"]

  C --> D["verified recovery"]
  D -. "status and evidence" .-> B
```

The path begins with a concrete input: a user request, configuration revision, packet, job, model request or operational symptom. The relevant subsystem validates that input, reads current state, performs or schedules work and exposes a result. Some transitions complete before the caller receives a response; others acknowledge the request and converge later. That difference determines whether a timeout means "nothing happened," "the operation failed," or "the final result is still unknown."

For **Observability fundamentals**, the important stages are Metrics, Logs, Traces, Events, Profiles, Correlation, Context propagation, Structured telemetry. Their boundaries explain where identity is checked, where state becomes durable, where capacity is consumed, how failures propagate and which signal can distinguish one layer from another. A production explanation should follow the actual path rather than treating each term as an isolated definition.


### Core concepts explained in detail

#### Metrics

**What it is.** Metrics are timestamped numeric measurements, usually organized as time series with bounded labels. Counters, gauges and histogram-like distributions summarize rates, levels and latency without preserving every individual event.

**Junior mental model.** Telemetry is the instrument panel, not the system itself. Metrics summarize trends, logs preserve discrete context, traces connect work across boundaries, profiles attribute resource use, and audit events record security-relevant actions.

**How it works.** Instrumentation observes a defined event or state, attaches bounded context, transports the signal, stores it under retention rules and makes it queryable. A useful signal has documented semantics and can distinguish at least two competing explanations; correlation identifiers belong in logs or traces rather than unbounded metric labels.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence includes coverage of the user journey, known collection delay and actionable SLO or saturation views. Missing telemetry, sampling bias, cardinality explosions, sensitive payload capture and alert thresholds disconnected from user impact are failures of the observability system itself.

#### Logs

**What it is.** Logs are discrete timestamped records of events or state transitions. Structured logs make stable fields queryable, while message text and high-cardinality identifiers preserve detail that would be unsafe or expensive as metric labels.

#### Traces

**What it is.** A distributed trace represents one request or unit of work as causally related spans across services. Each span records timing, status, attributes and parent/child context for one operation boundary.

#### Events

**What it is.** Operational events are discrete records that something happened, such as a deployment, scheduler decision or resource state change. They add change context but may be best-effort and short-lived rather than a durable audit history.

#### Profiles

**What it is.** Profiles aggregate where a program spends CPU time, allocations, lock wait or other sampled resources. They attribute cost inside a process when request-level metrics or traces show that a service is slow but not which code consumes the resource.

#### Correlation

**What it is.** Correlation connects signals that describe the same request, revision, tenant or incident window. It narrows investigation but does not by itself prove causation; time, propagation and dependency evidence still matter.

#### Context propagation

**What it is.** Context propagation carries trace, correlation and selected baggage fields across process and asynchronous boundaries so downstream telemetry can be joined to the originating work without relying only on timestamps.

#### Structured telemetry

**What it is.** Structured telemetry encodes fields according to a stable schema instead of embedding all meaning in free text. Consistent names, units and semantic conventions make queries and cross-service correlation reliable.

### Worked command and configuration example

The following is a diagnostic example, not an unexplained command dump. Define every uppercase placeholder first—for example `NAME`, `RESOURCE`, `PROJECT`, `REGION`, `NAMESPACE`, `URL`, `IMAGE` or `CONTAINER`—and use a sandbox or read-only production role.

```bash
curl -s http://SERVICE/metrics
promtool check rules rules.yml
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
trivy fs .
```

What the example demonstrates:

- `curl -s http://SERVICE/metrics` tests one part of the end-to-end request path and preserves protocol-level evidence such as resolution, connection, handshake, status or packet direction.
- `promtool check rules rules.yml` captures a read-oriented state snapshot that must be interpreted against a healthy baseline, the exact target and the next adjacent dependency.
- `kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp` reads Kubernetes API desired/status state or recent reconciliation evidence without treating a single `Ready` value as proof of the user journey.
- `trivy fs .` captures a read-oriented state snapshot that must be interpreted against a healthy baseline, the exact target and the next adjacent dependency.

A healthy run returns the intended identity/context, exits successfully and shows the expected object or response without a new warning, retry loop or saturation signal. A failure is useful evidence: preserve the exact exit code, status/reason, timestamp and target, then inspect the immediately adjacent layer before changing anything. This makes the example part of the explanation of **Observability fundamentals**, not merely a list to copy.

### Security, reliability and production ownership

Security controls who can initiate a transition and what data or resource that transition may affect. Authentication, authorization, network reachability, encryption and audit solve different problems and must align at each boundary. Short-lived attributable identities, least privilege, explicit tenant separation and tested key/certificate rotation reduce blast radius. Logs and traces need their own data controls because copying a secret or customer payload into telemetry defeats the primary protection.

Reliability depends on every synchronous dependency and on the eventual convergence of asynchronous work. Timeouts bound waiting; idempotency makes an ambiguous retry safe; backpressure and load shedding keep demand within useful capacity; replication and failover help only across independent failure domains. Recovery must be tested from protected state and verified through the original user outcome, not inferred from a green administrative status.

Ownership makes these mechanisms operable. Every production resource or service needs an accountable team, source-of-truth revision, environment and data classification, SLO, runbook, cost center and retirement policy. Reversible mitigation can stabilize an incident, but the durable repair belongs in Git, IaC, policy or the owning application so reconciliation does not reintroduce the fault.

### Observability, performance and cost

Metrics, logs, traces, profiles and audit events are complementary. A useful diagnostic path starts with time, identity, exact target and user symptom, then compares desired and observed state before moving through reconciliation, network/protocol, runtime, dependency and saturation layers. High-cardinality request or object IDs belong in sampled logs or traces rather than metric labels; alerts should represent actionable user-impact risk or leading exhaustion.

Performance is governed by work distribution, queueing and bottlenecks. Rate, latency percentiles, errors, saturation, queue depth or age and service-specific limits reveal more than average utilization. Application replicas and underlying machines, storage or provider quota scale through separate loops with different cold delays. Cost includes idle headroom, requests or work units, storage/retention, network transfer, telemetry, support and recovery capacity; optimize cost per successful outcome rather than the cheapest isolated resource.

## Practice

### Practice objective

Build a small, safe proof of **Observability fundamentals** and explain the result in your own words. The goal is not command completion; it is to connect input, internal mechanism, observable state and user outcome.

### Prerequisites and setup

Use a disposable local or cloud sandbox. Confirm identity/context and cost boundary, capture a healthy baseline with the commands above, introduce one bounded configuration or invalid-input failure, compare evidence, revert from source control, verify the original outcome, and delete only the named lab resources.

Record tool and platform versions because flags, APIs and defaults can change. Define every uppercase placeholder before use and keep secrets out of shell history and committed files.

### Activity 1: establish a healthy baseline

Run the read-oriented example first:

```bash
curl -s http://SERVICE/metrics
promtool check rules rules.yml
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
trivy fs .
```

For each line, write down the layer it inspects, the expected healthy field or response, and one thing it cannot prove. The expected result is an attributable request against the intended target plus enough state to draw the path from input to outcome.

### Activity 2: create or review the smallest working example

Put the smallest relevant command, configuration, manifest or code sample in source control. Validate or lint it, produce a preview/diff where the tool supports one, and apply only inside the disposable boundary. Record the exact revision and resulting resource or process ID. If the topic is observational rather than configurable, save a sanitized baseline and an automated assertion instead of mutating the system.

### Activity 3: controlled failure and troubleshooting

Introduce one bounded failure: use a definitely nonexistent resource name, an invalid sandbox-only value, a denied test identity, a closed test port or a stopped disposable dependency. Capture the exact error and classify it as identity/policy, input/configuration, control-plane reconciliation, network/protocol, dependency or capacity. Test one discriminating hypothesis at a time; do not widen access or restart unrelated components.

Expected failure evidence is a specific non-zero exit, status/reason, event or protocol response that disappears when the controlled fault is removed. If healthy and failing runs look identical, the chosen signal does not explain the phenomenon and the exercise is not complete.

### Verification

Repeat the original client or user-facing check, not only an administrative status command. Confirm the desired revision, data correctness where applicable, error and latency recovery, and absence of a continuing retry/backlog/saturation condition. Explain why this evidence proves recovery and what uncertainty remains.

### Cleanup and rollback

Revert the configuration in its source of truth and review the rollback diff before applying it. Delete only the named sandbox resources, stop disposable processes, remove temporary credentials and verify that no billable resource, volume, artifact, queue item or background job remains. Read-only activities require no infrastructure rollback, but sanitized captures must still follow retention policy.

### Harder extension

Automate the healthy and failing paths in CI, use short-lived identity, add one SLI/alert or policy assertion, and write a five-step runbook another engineer can execute without hidden context. Then explain how the design changes for two tenants, a zonal or dependency failure, 10× load and a strict cost or recovery target.
