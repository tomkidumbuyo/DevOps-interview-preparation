## Explanation

### What it is and why it exists

**Compute** is easiest to understand as one part of a larger path. The subject has an API control plane and a workload data plane. An authenticated request is authorized, validated and persisted; managed controllers then create or reconfigure regional or global resources that serve traffic or process data.

The chapter focuses on Instance family, CPU architecture, AMI, Golden image. These are connected mechanisms, not vocabulary to memorize. Integrate the compute branch as one production capability rather than isolated products The explanations below first build the simple model, then add the exact system behavior and production consequences.

### History and evolution

AWS helped turn infrastructure into an on-demand API with services such as S3 and EC2 in 2006. The platform expanded from individual virtual resources into regional managed control planes, global identity and governance, event-driven services and specialized data and AI systems; automation therefore became as important as resource creation.

In this chapter, **Compute** is the next layer of that evolution. Its modern purpose is to integrate the compute branch as one production capability rather than isolated products. The exact product surface may change by version, but the underlying state, request path and failure boundaries remain the durable ideas to learn.

### How it works: the end-to-end path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["signed API request"] --> B["IAM and service control plane"]
  B --> C["Compute: regional or global data plane"]
  C --> D["customer outcome"]
  D -. "status and evidence" .-> B
```

The diagram is a feedback loop rather than a one-way provisioning sequence. A caller supplies identity and intent; the control plane validates and records that intent; asynchronous controllers, runtimes or managed infrastructure create the effective data plane; and status and telemetry feed the next decision. A successful API response can therefore mean only "the request was accepted," not "the workload outcome is healthy."

For **Compute**, the mechanisms participating in that loop are Instance family, CPU architecture, AMI, Golden image, Launch template, Min/max/desired. Some run synchronously on the caller's request, while others converge later. This timing distinction explains many production surprises: the desired object can exist before capacity is ready, a data path can continue while its control plane is impaired, and a timeout can leave the final side effect unknown.

### Core concepts explained in detail

#### Instance family

**What it is.** General, compute, memory, storage and accelerator families target different bottlenecks.

**Junior mental model.** The simplest mental model is a state machine: an input is checked, current state is read, a rule computes the next state, and an observable result tells callers whether the transition succeeded.

**How it works.** The mechanism receives configuration or runtime input, validates preconditions, changes or derives state, and exposes status to the next component. Synchronous parts return a direct outcome; asynchronous parts need durable status, reconciliation and idempotency because the original caller may disappear.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows the expected state transition and its owner, timestamp and reason. Invalid input, stale state, conflicting writers, hidden limits and dependencies that partially complete are the most useful failure categories to distinguish.

#### CPU architecture

**What it is.** X86 and Graviton/ARM require compatible AMIs, agents and multi-architecture artifacts.

**Junior mental model.** Think of a scheduler as allocating seats and time slots: a request states what it needs, available workers advertise capacity, and policy chooses a placement. Requested capacity, usable capacity and completed useful work are different quantities.

**How it works.** Work enters a runnable or pending state, eligibility filters remove incompatible placements, scoring or queue policy selects a worker, and a runtime creates the process and accounts for CPU, memory, devices and time. Autoscaling observes demand, requests more replicas or machines, and waits through provisioning and warm-up before capacity becomes useful.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence connects queue delay, placement, utilization, throttling, memory/device pressure, runtime readiness and successful work. Fragmentation, inaccurate requests, quota, topology, cold starts and a saturated downstream service can leave capacity apparently free while latency and pending work grow.

#### AMI

**What it is.** Boot image metadata and snapshots define instance root and launch compatibility.

**Junior mental model.** The simplest mental model is a state machine: an input is checked, current state is read, a rule computes the next state, and an observable result tells callers whether the transition succeeded.

**How it works.** The mechanism receives configuration or runtime input, validates preconditions, changes or derives state, and exposes status to the next component. Synchronous parts return a direct outcome; asynchronous parts need durable status, reconciliation and idempotency because the original caller may disappear.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows the expected state transition and its owner, timestamp and reason. Invalid input, stale state, conflicting writers, hidden limits and dependencies that partially complete are the most useful failure categories to distinguish.

#### Golden image

**What it is.** Centrally hardened/tested base reduces bootstrap drift and replacement time.

**Junior mental model.** Treat delivery like a controlled assembly line: reviewed source becomes an immutable artifact, the artifact is promoted without being rebuilt, and each environment records exactly which revision is effective.

**How it works.** The lifecycle begins with versioned intent, validates syntax and policy, resolves dependencies, builds or selects immutable inputs, produces a diff or release plan, changes the target in bounded waves, and records status. Reconciliation keeps desired and observed state aligned; rollback is another tested state transition, not merely a command name.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence links source revision, review, test, artifact digest, signer/provenance, deployment target and user-facing verification. Mutable tags, environment-specific rebuilds, unpinned dependencies, non-idempotent migrations and controllers fighting emergency changes are recurring failure modes.

#### Launch template

**What it is.** Versions instance image/type/network/role/storage/bootstrap inputs.

**Junior mental model.** The simplest mental model is a state machine: an input is checked, current state is read, a rule computes the next state, and an observable result tells callers whether the transition succeeded.

**How it works.** The mechanism receives configuration or runtime input, validates preconditions, changes or derives state, and exposes status to the next component. Synchronous parts return a direct outcome; asynchronous parts need durable status, reconciliation and idempotency because the original caller may disappear.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows the expected state transition and its owner, timestamp and reason. Invalid input, stale state, conflicting writers, hidden limits and dependencies that partially complete are the most useful failure categories to distinguish.

#### Min/max/desired

**What it is.** Bound fleet capacity while policies adjust desired count.

### Worked command and configuration example

The following is a diagnostic example, not an unexplained command dump. Define every uppercase placeholder first—for example `NAME`, `RESOURCE`, `PROJECT`, `REGION`, `NAMESPACE`, `URL`, `IMAGE` or `CONTAINER`—and use a sandbox or read-only production role.

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids INSTANCE_ID
aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-names ASG
```

What the example demonstrates:

- `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids INSTANCE_ID` queries the AWS service control plane; IDs, Region, status/reason fields and request attribution should be correlated with CloudTrail and service metrics.
- `aws ec2 describe-images --owners self` queries the AWS service control plane; IDs, Region, status/reason fields and request attribution should be correlated with CloudTrail and service metrics.
- `aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-names ASG` queries the AWS service control plane; IDs, Region, status/reason fields and request attribution should be correlated with CloudTrail and service metrics.

A healthy run returns the intended identity/context, exits successfully and shows the expected object or response without a new warning, retry loop or saturation signal. A failure is useful evidence: preserve the exact exit code, status/reason, timestamp and target, then inspect the immediately adjacent layer before changing anything. This makes the example part of the explanation of **Compute**, not merely a list to copy.

### Security and trust boundaries

Security begins with the actor and the exact operation, not with a network location. Human, workload, CI and service identities have different lifecycles; every hop must authenticate the relevant identity and authorize the action against the resource and current conditions. Network controls reduce reachable paths, while resource policy and application authorization decide what an already-reachable caller may do. Encryption protects data in transit or at rest, but key access, rotation, revocation and recovery are part of the same system.

The safe design minimizes public paths, long-lived credentials, wildcard permissions and implicit cross-tenant trust. It also protects the evidence plane: audit logs, traces and command history must not become a second copy of secrets or customer content. A production review should be able to identify the enforcement point, default behavior, bypass path, break-glass owner and proof that revoked access actually stops working.

### Reliability and failure behavior

Availability is an end-to-end property. The service depends on identity, quota, API/control-plane health, DNS and network paths, capacity, downstream services and any durable state required to recover. Replicas improve availability only when they occupy independent failure domains and clients can reach a healthy replica; a managed-service label does not remove customer responsibility for configuration, load, data correctness or recovery testing.

Timeouts, bounded retry budgets with jitter, idempotency, backpressure, load shedding and graceful drain control how failures spread. They must match the protocol and side-effect model. A timeout is ambiguous because the remote operation may have completed; blind retry is unsafe when the operation is not idempotent. Recovery is complete only when the original user action works and data, latency, error rate and backlog have returned to acceptable bounds.

### Performance, scaling and cost

Capacity planning starts with a work unit and a distribution, not an average utilization percentage. Relevant signals include request or job arrival rate, work size, latency percentiles, errors, queue age, saturation and service-specific limits. Scaling application replicas and provisioning underlying nodes, storage or provider quota are separate feedback loops with different delays. Cold starts and warm-up determine whether newly allocated capacity helps before the burst is over.

Total cost includes idle headroom, request or token work, storage and retention, cross-zone or cross-Region transfer, NAT/egress, observability, licenses and recovery capacity. The useful optimization target is cost per successful SLO- or quality-controlled outcome. A cheaper configuration that increases retries, operator toil, data risk or missed objectives can raise total cost.

### Observability and troubleshooting

Diagnosis follows the same path as the request. First establish time, user impact, identity and exact target; then compare desired configuration with observed status and recent changes. Continue through control-plane reconciliation, network and protocol evidence, runtime state, dependencies and resource saturation. Metrics show trends, logs explain discrete events, traces connect boundaries, profiles attribute resource use and audit logs explain security decisions.

The most useful next check is the one that distinguishes competing causes. A permission denial calls for policy-evaluation evidence, not a restart; a connection refusal means something different from a timeout; a pending resource with a scheduling reason differs from a running resource whose application is unready. Reversible mitigation stabilizes impact, while the durable repair updates Git, IaC, policy or the owning service and adds a regression test or alert.

### Common interview traps

- Naming a feature without explaining request/resource lifecycle or failure semantics.
- Treating an allow, encryption checkbox, replica count or managed-service label as a complete security/reliability design.
- Mutating production before capturing identity, status, events, metrics, logs, audit and recent changes.
- Scaling the wrong layer or retrying overload/permanent errors.
- Omitting quotas, cold start, deletion/restore, observability cost or customer/tenant boundaries.

## Practice

### Practice objective

Build a small, safe proof of **Compute** and explain the result in your own words. The goal is not command completion; it is to connect input, internal mechanism, observable state and user outcome.

### Prerequisites and setup

Use a disposable local environment, sandbox account/project or isolated namespace. Confirm the effective identity and target, record the start time, and set a cost limit before creating anything.

Record tool and platform versions because flags, APIs and defaults can change. Define every uppercase placeholder before use and keep secrets out of shell history and committed files.

### Activity 1: establish a healthy baseline

Run the read-oriented example first:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids INSTANCE_ID
aws ec2 describe-images --owners self
aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-names ASG
```

For each line, write down the layer it inspects, the expected healthy field or response, and one thing it cannot prove. The expected result is an attributable request against the intended target plus enough state to draw the path from input to outcome.

### Activity 2: create or review the smallest working example

Put the smallest relevant command, configuration, manifest or code sample in source control. Validate or lint it, produce a preview/diff where the tool supports one, and apply only inside the disposable boundary. Record the exact revision and resulting resource or process ID. If the topic is observational rather than configurable, save a sanitized baseline and an automated assertion instead of mutating the system.

### Activity 3: controlled failure and troubleshooting

Introduce one bounded failure: use a definitely nonexistent resource name, an invalid sandbox-only value, a denied test identity, a closed test port or a stopped disposable dependency. Capture the exact error and classify it as identity/policy, input/configuration, control-plane reconciliation, network/protocol, dependency or capacity. Test one discriminating hypothesis at a time; do not widen access or restart unrelated components.

Expected failure evidence is a specific non-zero exit, status/reason, event or protocol response that disappears when the controlled fault is removed. If healthy and failing runs look identical, the chosen signal does not explain the phenomenon and the exercise is not complete.

### Verification

Repeat the original client or user-facing check, not only an administrative status command. Confirm the desired revision, data correctness where applicable, error and latency recovery, and absence of a continuing retry/backlog/saturation condition. Explain why this evidence proves recovery and what uncertainty remains.

### Cleanup and rollback

Revert the configuration in its source of truth and review the rollback diff before applying it. Delete only the named sandbox resources, stop disposable processes, remove temporary credentials and verify that no billable resource, volume, artifact, queue item or background job remains. Read-only activities require no infrastructure rollback, but sanitized captures must still follow retention policy.

### Harder extension

Automate the healthy and failing paths in CI, use short-lived identity, add one SLI/alert or policy assertion, and write a five-step runbook another engineer can execute without hidden context. Then explain how the design changes for two tenants, a zonal or dependency failure, 10× load and a strict cost or recovery target.
