## Self-grading

A complete spoken answer names the mechanism, scope/assumptions, one concrete command or configuration field, a failure mode, security/recovery, an SLI and a cost/trade-off. For procedural answers, explicitly separate immediate reversible mitigation from durable source-of-truth repair.
