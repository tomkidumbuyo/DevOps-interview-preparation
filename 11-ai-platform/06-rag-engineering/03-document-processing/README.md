## Explanation

### What it is and why it exists

**Document processing** is easiest to understand as one part of a larger path. The subject links data, model and runtime state. A versioned input becomes an artifact, a serving system turns requests into token or prediction work, and evaluation decides whether quality, safety, latency and cost are acceptable.

The chapter focuses on Text extraction, PDF processing, OCR, Table extraction. These are connected mechanisms, not vocabulary to memorize. Document processing is the part of RAG engineering that connects the listed mechanisms to effective runtime state, observable behavior and production outcomes The explanations below first build the simple model, then add the exact system behavior and production consequences.

### History and evolution

Machine-learning systems evolved from offline statistical jobs into GPU-intensive training and always-on inference platforms. Foundation models added token-based capacity, very large artifacts, probabilistic quality and new safety concerns, so model, data, prompt, runtime and evaluation revisions now have to travel as one governed release.

In this chapter, **Document processing** is the next layer of that evolution. Its modern purpose is to document processing is the part of RAG engineering that connects the listed mechanisms to effective runtime state, observable behavior and production outcomes. The exact product surface may change by version, but the underlying state, request path and failure boundaries remain the durable ideas to learn.

### How it works: the end-to-end path

  A["data prompt or request"] --> B["model and platform control"]
  B --> C["Document processing: training or inference runtime"]
  C --> D["quality-controlled result"]
  D -. "status and evidence" .-> B
```

The path begins with a concrete input: a user request, configuration revision, packet, job, model request or operational symptom. The relevant subsystem validates that input, reads current state, performs or schedules work and exposes a result. Some transitions complete before the caller receives a response; others acknowledge the request and converge later. That difference determines whether a timeout means "nothing happened," "the operation failed," or "the final result is still unknown."

For **Document processing**, the important stages are Text extraction, PDF processing, OCR, Table extraction, Metadata extraction, Language detection, Deduplication, Data cleaning, PII detection. Their boundaries explain where identity is checked, where state becomes durable, where capacity is consumed, how failures propagate and which signal can distinguish one layer from another. A production explanation should follow the actual path rather than treating each term as an isolated definition.


### Core concepts explained in detail

#### Text extraction

**What it is.** The term Text extraction refers to an AI lifecycle mechanism that affects the identity, quality, safety, performance or cost of a data, model or runtime revision within Document processing.

**Junior mental model.** An AI result is produced by a release made of several moving parts—not only model weights. Data, tokenizer, prompt/template, adapter, retrieval index, runtime, hardware and evaluator can each change behavior.

**How it works.** Inputs are validated and transformed, a versioned model or pipeline performs work, and post-processing and policy produce the exposed result. Offline evaluation compares a candidate with a baseline; shadow or canary traffic supplies production evidence; lineage connects the decision back to exact artifacts and data.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence combines task quality and safety with latency, token or accelerator work, failure rate and unit cost. Training-serving skew, stale or unauthorized retrieval, incompatible runtime/hardware, biased evaluators, prompt injection and silent provider/model changes are core production risks.

#### PDF processing

**What it is.** The term PDF processing refers to an AI lifecycle mechanism that affects the identity, quality, safety, performance or cost of a data, model or runtime revision within Document processing.

**Junior mental model.** Think of a scheduler as allocating seats and time slots: a request states what it needs, available workers advertise capacity, and policy chooses a placement. Requested capacity, usable capacity and completed useful work are different quantities.

**How it works.** Work enters a runnable or pending state, eligibility filters remove incompatible placements, scoring or queue policy selects a worker, and a runtime creates the process and accounts for CPU, memory, devices and time. Autoscaling observes demand, requests more replicas or machines, and waits through provisioning and warm-up before capacity becomes useful.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence connects queue delay, placement, utilization, throttling, memory/device pressure, runtime readiness and successful work. Fragmentation, inaccurate requests, quota, topology, cold starts and a saturated downstream service can leave capacity apparently free while latency and pending work grow.

### Worked command and configuration example

The following is a diagnostic example, not an unexplained command dump. Define every uppercase placeholder first—for example `NAME`, `RESOURCE`, `PROJECT`, `REGION`, `NAMESPACE`, `URL`, `IMAGE` or `CONTAINER`—and use a sandbox or read-only production role.

```bash
nvidia-smi
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
curl -s http://MODEL/metrics
python -m pytest -q
```

What the example demonstrates:

- `nvidia-smi` shows the host-visible GPU, driver, topology or workload state; it proves hardware visibility but not framework compatibility or useful model goodput.
- `kubectl get pods -A -o wide` reads Kubernetes API desired/status state or recent reconciliation evidence without treating a single `Ready` value as proof of the user journey.
- `curl -s http://MODEL/metrics` tests one part of the end-to-end request path and preserves protocol-level evidence such as resolution, connection, handshake, status or packet direction.
- `python -m pytest -q` captures a read-oriented state snapshot that must be interpreted against a healthy baseline, the exact target and the next adjacent dependency.

A healthy run returns the intended identity/context, exits successfully and shows the expected object or response without a new warning, retry loop or saturation signal. A failure is useful evidence: preserve the exact exit code, status/reason, timestamp and target, then inspect the immediately adjacent layer before changing anything. This makes the example part of the explanation of **Document processing**, not merely a list to copy.

### Security, reliability and production ownership

Security controls who can initiate a transition and what data or resource that transition may affect. Authentication, authorization, network reachability, encryption and audit solve different problems and must align at each boundary. Short-lived attributable identities, least privilege, explicit tenant separation and tested key/certificate rotation reduce blast radius. Logs and traces need their own data controls because copying a secret or customer payload into telemetry defeats the primary protection.

Reliability depends on every synchronous dependency and on the eventual convergence of asynchronous work. Timeouts bound waiting; idempotency makes an ambiguous retry safe; backpressure and load shedding keep demand within useful capacity; replication and failover help only across independent failure domains. Recovery must be tested from protected state and verified through the original user outcome, not inferred from a green administrative status.

Ownership makes these mechanisms operable. Every production resource or service needs an accountable team, source-of-truth revision, environment and data classification, SLO, runbook, cost center and retirement policy. Reversible mitigation can stabilize an incident, but the durable repair belongs in Git, IaC, policy or the owning application so reconciliation does not reintroduce the fault.

### Observability, performance and cost

Metrics, logs, traces, profiles and audit events are complementary. A useful diagnostic path starts with time, identity, exact target and user symptom, then compares desired and observed state before moving through reconciliation, network/protocol, runtime, dependency and saturation layers. High-cardinality request or object IDs belong in sampled logs or traces rather than metric labels; alerts should represent actionable user-impact risk or leading exhaustion.

Performance is governed by work distribution, queueing and bottlenecks. Rate, latency percentiles, errors, saturation, queue depth or age and service-specific limits reveal more than average utilization. Application replicas and underlying machines, storage or provider quota scale through separate loops with different cold delays. Cost includes idle headroom, requests or work units, storage/retention, network transfer, telemetry, support and recovery capacity; optimize cost per successful outcome rather than the cheapest isolated resource.

## Practice

### Practice objective

Build a small, safe proof of **Document processing** and explain the result in your own words. The goal is not command completion; it is to connect input, internal mechanism, observable state and user outcome.

### Prerequisites and setup

Use a tiny local model or approved sandbox endpoint and a versioned JSONL dataset. Record model/tokenizer/prompt/runtime/hardware and baseline latency, token and quality metrics; change one bounded variable; rerun; compare; then simulate an unavailable route or rejected request and verify safe fallback/denial. Cleanup artifacts, endpoint and cached test data according to their classification and retention policy.

Record tool and platform versions because flags, APIs and defaults can change. Define every uppercase placeholder before use and keep secrets out of shell history and committed files.

### Activity 1: establish a healthy baseline

Run the read-oriented example first:

```bash
nvidia-smi
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
curl -s http://MODEL/metrics
python -m pytest -q
```

For each line, write down the layer it inspects, the expected healthy field or response, and one thing it cannot prove. The expected result is an attributable request against the intended target plus enough state to draw the path from input to outcome.

### Activity 2: create or review the smallest working example

Put the smallest relevant command, configuration, manifest or code sample in source control. Validate or lint it, produce a preview/diff where the tool supports one, and apply only inside the disposable boundary. Record the exact revision and resulting resource or process ID. If the topic is observational rather than configurable, save a sanitized baseline and an automated assertion instead of mutating the system.

### Activity 3: controlled failure and troubleshooting

Introduce one bounded failure: use a definitely nonexistent resource name, an invalid sandbox-only value, a denied test identity, a closed test port or a stopped disposable dependency. Capture the exact error and classify it as identity/policy, input/configuration, control-plane reconciliation, network/protocol, dependency or capacity. Test one discriminating hypothesis at a time; do not widen access or restart unrelated components.

Expected failure evidence is a specific non-zero exit, status/reason, event or protocol response that disappears when the controlled fault is removed. If healthy and failing runs look identical, the chosen signal does not explain the phenomenon and the exercise is not complete.

### Verification

Repeat the original client or user-facing check, not only an administrative status command. Confirm the desired revision, data correctness where applicable, error and latency recovery, and absence of a continuing retry/backlog/saturation condition. Explain why this evidence proves recovery and what uncertainty remains.

### Cleanup and rollback

Revert the configuration in its source of truth and review the rollback diff before applying it. Delete only the named sandbox resources, stop disposable processes, remove temporary credentials and verify that no billable resource, volume, artifact, queue item or background job remains. Read-only activities require no infrastructure rollback, but sanitized captures must still follow retention policy.

### Harder extension

Automate the healthy and failing paths in CI, use short-lived identity, add one SLI/alert or policy assertion, and write a five-step runbook another engineer can execute without hidden context. Then explain how the design changes for two tenants, a zonal or dependency failure, 10× load and a strict cost or recovery target.
