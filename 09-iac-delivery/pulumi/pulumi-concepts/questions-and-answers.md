## Senior — procedural incident, migration and ownership questions

### PULUMI-CONCEPTS-SP-01

- [ ] **Incident/migration:** **Question:** You own a high-severity failure or migration involving Projects. How do you lead it end to end?

**Answer:** Establish incident/change command, impact, decision rights, communications cadence and abort criteria. Preserve evidence and use `terraform fmt -check -recursive` as one read-only checkpoint, not the whole diagnosis. is part of Pulumi concepts; learn its precise definition, mechanism and lifecycle, nearest alternatives, configuration interface, failure/limit, security boundary, observable evidence and production trade-off.

## Self-grading

A complete spoken answer names the mechanism, scope/assumptions, one concrete command or configuration field, a failure mode, security/recovery, an SLI and a cost/trade-off. For procedural answers, explicitly separate immediate reversible mitigation from durable source-of-truth repair.
