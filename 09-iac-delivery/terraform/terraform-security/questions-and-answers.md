## Senior — procedural incident, migration and ownership questions

### TERRAFORM-SECURITY-SP-01

- [ ] **Incident/migration:** **Question:** You own a high-severity failure or migration involving Credential handling. How do you lead it end to end?

## Self-grading

A complete spoken answer names the mechanism, scope/assumptions, one concrete command or configuration field, a failure mode, security/recovery, an SLI and a cost/trade-off. For procedural answers, explicitly separate immediate reversible mitigation from durable source-of-truth repair.
