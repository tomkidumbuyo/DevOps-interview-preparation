Relevant facts: is part of systemd; learn its precise definition, mechanism and lifecycle, nearest alternatives, configuration interface, failure/limit, security boundary, observable evidence and production trade-off. requires a layer-by-layer, evidence-first path from user impact and recent change through identity, configuration, runtime, dependency and resource saturation, followed by reversible mitigation and verified repair. is part of systemd; learn its precise definition, mechanism and lifecycle, nearest alternatives, configuration interface, failure/limit, security boundary, observable evidence and production trade-off.

## Senior — procedural incident, migration and ownership questions

### SYSTEMD-SP-01

- [ ] **Incident/migration:** **Question:** You own a high-severity failure or migration involving Units. How do you lead it end to end?

**Answer:** Establish incident/change command, impact, decision rights, communications cadence and abort criteria.

## Self-grading

A complete spoken answer names the mechanism, scope/assumptions, one concrete command or configuration field, a failure mode, security/recovery, an SLI and a cost/trade-off. For procedural answers, explicitly separate immediate reversible mitigation from durable source-of-truth repair.
