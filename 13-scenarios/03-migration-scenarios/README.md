## Explanation

### What it is and why it exists

**Migration scenarios** is easiest to understand as one part of a larger path. The subject is an evidence-driven decision path. Start with a user-visible symptom, separate the system into layers, test the cheapest discriminating hypothesis and keep mitigation distinct from the durable repair.

The chapter focuses on EC2 to Kubernetes, ECS to EKS, Self-managed Kubernetes to EKS or GKE, Terraform monolith to modules. These are connected mechanisms, not vocabulary to memorize. Integrate every part of Migration scenarios into one secure, reliable, observable, supportable and cost-aware production capability The explanations below first build the simple model, then add the exact system behavior and production consequences.

### History and evolution

Case-based technical learning mirrors incident drills, game days and design reviews used by production teams. A scenario is valuable because it forces several mechanisms to interact under incomplete evidence, which is closer to real operations than recalling an isolated definition.

In this chapter, **Migration scenarios** is the next layer of that evolution. Its modern purpose is to integrate every part of Migration scenarios into one secure, reliable, observable, supportable and cost-aware production capability. The exact product surface may change by version, but the underlying state, request path and failure boundaries remain the durable ideas to learn.

### How it works: the end-to-end path

  A["symptom"] --> B["evidence and hypothesis"]
  B --> C["Migration scenarios: reversible mitigation and repair"]
  C --> D["user verification"]
  D -. "status and evidence" .-> B
```

The path begins with a concrete input: a user request, configuration revision, packet, job, model request or operational symptom. The relevant subsystem validates that input, reads current state, performs or schedules work and exposes a result. Some transitions complete before the caller receives a response; others acknowledge the request and converge later. That difference determines whether a timeout means "nothing happened," "the operation failed," or "the final result is still unknown."

For **Migration scenarios**, the important stages are EC2 to Kubernetes, ECS to EKS, Self-managed Kubernetes to EKS or GKE, Terraform monolith to modules, Terraform to Pulumi, Manual infrastructure to IaC, Ingress to Gateway API, Single-cloud to multi-cloud, Managed LLM API to self-hosted models, One model server to KServe, One provider to a gateway architecture, Single-tenant RAG to multi-tenant RAG, Shared GPU nodes to isolated pools, Non-GitOps deployment to Argo CD, Non-observable AI application to OpenTelemetry. Their boundaries explain where identity is checked, where state becomes durable, where capacity is consumed, how failures propagate and which signal can distinguish one layer from another. A production explanation should follow the actual path rather than treating each term as an isolated definition.


### Core concepts explained in detail

#### EC2 to Kubernetes

**What it is.** The term EC2 to Kubernetes refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Failure controls are traffic rules for unhealthy conditions: they bound how long work waits, how often it retries, how much enters the system and what reduced service remains possible.

**How it works.** A caller assigns a deadline and attempt budget, classifies an error, applies bounded backoff with jitter only when retry is safe, and propagates capacity limits upstream. Circuit breakers, bulkheads and load shedding prevent one dependency from consuming every worker; recovery probes and gradual traffic return avoid a second overload.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows bounded queues, stable retry ratios and recovery within an objective. Unbounded retries, identical timeouts at every layer, non-idempotent replays, shared resource pools and failover to an unqualified target commonly turn a small fault into an outage.

#### ECS to EKS

**What it is.** The term ECS to EKS refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Failure controls are traffic rules for unhealthy conditions: they bound how long work waits, how often it retries, how much enters the system and what reduced service remains possible.

**How it works.** A caller assigns a deadline and attempt budget, classifies an error, applies bounded backoff with jitter only when retry is safe, and propagates capacity limits upstream. Circuit breakers, bulkheads and load shedding prevent one dependency from consuming every worker; recovery probes and gradual traffic return avoid a second overload.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows bounded queues, stable retry ratios and recovery within an objective. Unbounded retries, identical timeouts at every layer, non-idempotent replays, shared resource pools and failover to an unqualified target commonly turn a small fault into an outage.

#### Self-managed Kubernetes to EKS or GKE

**What it is.** The term Self-managed Kubernetes to EKS or GKE refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Failure controls are traffic rules for unhealthy conditions: they bound how long work waits, how often it retries, how much enters the system and what reduced service remains possible.

**How it works.** A caller assigns a deadline and attempt budget, classifies an error, applies bounded backoff with jitter only when retry is safe, and propagates capacity limits upstream. Circuit breakers, bulkheads and load shedding prevent one dependency from consuming every worker; recovery probes and gradual traffic return avoid a second overload.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows bounded queues, stable retry ratios and recovery within an objective. Unbounded retries, identical timeouts at every layer, non-idempotent replays, shared resource pools and failover to an unqualified target commonly turn a small fault into an outage.

#### Terraform monolith to modules

**What it is.** The term Terraform monolith to modules refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Treat delivery like a controlled assembly line: reviewed source becomes an immutable artifact, the artifact is promoted without being rebuilt, and each environment records exactly which revision is effective.

**How it works.** The lifecycle begins with versioned intent, validates syntax and policy, resolves dependencies, builds or selects immutable inputs, produces a diff or release plan, changes the target in bounded waves, and records status. Reconciliation keeps desired and observed state aligned; rollback is another tested state transition, not merely a command name.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence links source revision, review, test, artifact digest, signer/provenance, deployment target and user-facing verification. Mutable tags, environment-specific rebuilds, unpinned dependencies, non-idempotent migrations and controllers fighting emergency changes are recurring failure modes.

#### Terraform to Pulumi

**What it is.** The term Terraform to Pulumi refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Treat delivery like a controlled assembly line: reviewed source becomes an immutable artifact, the artifact is promoted without being rebuilt, and each environment records exactly which revision is effective.

**How it works.** The lifecycle begins with versioned intent, validates syntax and policy, resolves dependencies, builds or selects immutable inputs, produces a diff or release plan, changes the target in bounded waves, and records status. Reconciliation keeps desired and observed state aligned; rollback is another tested state transition, not merely a command name.

Mutable tags, environment-specific rebuilds, unpinned dependencies, non-idempotent migrations and controllers fighting emergency changes are recurring failure modes.

#### Manual infrastructure to IaC

**What it is.** The term Manual infrastructure to IaC refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Failure controls are traffic rules for unhealthy conditions: they bound how long work waits, how often it retries, how much enters the system and what reduced service remains possible.

**How it works.** A caller assigns a deadline and attempt budget, classifies an error, applies bounded backoff with jitter only when retry is safe, and propagates capacity limits upstream. Circuit breakers, bulkheads and load shedding prevent one dependency from consuming every worker; recovery probes and gradual traffic return avoid a second overload.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows bounded queues, stable retry ratios and recovery within an objective. Unbounded retries, identical timeouts at every layer, non-idempotent replays, shared resource pools and failover to an unqualified target commonly turn a small fault into an outage.

#### Ingress to Gateway API

**What it is.** The term Ingress to Gateway API is a network-facing contract that defines request and response shape, authentication, errors, timeouts, compatibility and the point where callers meet the service data path within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** A useful analogy is a parcel journey: the name identifies the destination, routing selects each next hop, policy decides whether the parcel may pass, transport tracks delivery, and the application decides what the contents mean.

**How it works.** A real request crosses several independent states: name resolution returns an address, the source selects a route and source address, link or overlay forwarding reaches the next hop, stateful or stateless policy evaluates the flow, transport establishes communication, and TLS/application protocols negotiate their own contract. The return path must also work.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence progresses layer by layer: correct name/address, expected route, permitted flow, listening endpoint, successful handshake and valid application response. Timeouts, refusals, resets and protocol errors mean different layers; packet loss, MTU, asymmetric paths, connection-state exhaustion and proxy timeout mismatch are common production failures.

#### Single-cloud to multi-cloud

**What it is.** The term Single-cloud to multi-cloud refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Failure controls are traffic rules for unhealthy conditions: they bound how long work waits, how often it retries, how much enters the system and what reduced service remains possible.

**How it works.** A caller assigns a deadline and attempt budget, classifies an error, applies bounded backoff with jitter only when retry is safe, and propagates capacity limits upstream. Circuit breakers, bulkheads and load shedding prevent one dependency from consuming every worker; recovery probes and gradual traffic return avoid a second overload.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence shows bounded queues, stable retry ratios and recovery within an objective. Unbounded retries, identical timeouts at every layer, non-idempotent replays, shared resource pools and failover to an unqualified target commonly turn a small fault into an outage.

#### Managed LLM API to self-hosted models

**What it is.** The term Managed LLM API to self-hosted models is an AI data or behavior artifact whose exact revision, inputs, transformations, compatibility and evaluation evidence affect the result produced at runtime within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** An AI result is produced by a release made of several moving parts—not only model weights. Data, tokenizer, prompt/template, adapter, retrieval index, runtime, hardware and evaluator can each change behavior.

**How it works.** Inputs are validated and transformed, a versioned model or pipeline performs work, and post-processing and policy produce the exposed result. Offline evaluation compares a candidate with a baseline; shadow or canary traffic supplies production evidence; lineage connects the decision back to exact artifacts and data.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence combines task quality and safety with latency, token or accelerator work, failure rate and unit cost. Training-serving skew, stale or unauthorized retrieval, incompatible runtime/hardware, biased evaluators, prompt injection and silent provider/model changes are core production risks.

#### One model server to KServe

**What it is.** The term One model server to KServe is an AI data or behavior artifact whose exact revision, inputs, transformations, compatibility and evaluation evidence affect the result produced at runtime within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** An AI result is produced by a release made of several moving parts—not only model weights. Data, tokenizer, prompt/template, adapter, retrieval index, runtime, hardware and evaluator can each change behavior.

**How it works.** Inputs are validated and transformed, a versioned model or pipeline performs work, and post-processing and policy produce the exposed result. Offline evaluation compares a candidate with a baseline; shadow or canary traffic supplies production evidence; lineage connects the decision back to exact artifacts and data.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence combines task quality and safety with latency, token or accelerator work, failure rate and unit cost. Training-serving skew, stale or unauthorized retrieval, incompatible runtime/hardware, biased evaluators, prompt injection and silent provider/model changes are core production risks.

#### One provider to a gateway architecture

**What it is.** The term One provider to a gateway architecture describes how components, state and dependencies are arranged and where control, data, trust and failure boundaries sit within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** A useful analogy is a parcel journey: the name identifies the destination, routing selects each next hop, policy decides whether the parcel may pass, transport tracks delivery, and the application decides what the contents mean.

**How it works.** A real request crosses several independent states: name resolution returns an address, the source selects a route and source address, link or overlay forwarding reaches the next hop, stateful or stateless policy evaluates the flow, transport establishes communication, and TLS/application protocols negotiate their own contract. The return path must also work.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence progresses layer by layer: correct name/address, expected route, permitted flow, listening endpoint, successful handshake and valid application response. Timeouts, refusals, resets and protocol errors mean different layers; packet loss, MTU, asymmetric paths, connection-state exhaustion and proxy timeout mismatch are common production failures.

#### Single-tenant RAG to multi-tenant RAG

**What it is.** The term Single-tenant RAG to multi-tenant RAG is an AI data or behavior artifact whose exact revision, inputs, transformations, compatibility and evaluation evidence affect the result produced at runtime within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Think of this as a badge plus a checkpoint: identity says who or what is acting, while policy decides whether that actor may perform this exact action on this exact target under the current conditions.

**How it works.** At runtime a caller presents or derives an identity, the enforcement point gathers identity, resource and request context, and applicable rules produce allow or deny. The effective decision is the intersection of all guardrails; encryption protects bytes but does not replace authorization, and audit records explain which decision was made.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence includes a short-lived attributable identity, narrowly scoped access and an audit event for the intended resource. Failures commonly come from expired credentials, mismatched trust, an overriding deny, wrong resource scope or key/certificate lifecycle problems; widening access may hide the cause while creating a breach path.

#### Shared GPU nodes to isolated pools

**What it is.** The term Shared GPU nodes to isolated pools refers to a diagnostic mechanism that distinguishes competing causes and supports a reversible operational decision within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Think of a scheduler as allocating seats and time slots: a request states what it needs, available workers advertise capacity, and policy chooses a placement. Requested capacity, usable capacity and completed useful work are different quantities.

**How it works.** Work enters a runnable or pending state, eligibility filters remove incompatible placements, scoring or queue policy selects a worker, and a runtime creates the process and accounts for CPU, memory, devices and time. Autoscaling observes demand, requests more replicas or machines, and waits through provisioning and warm-up before capacity becomes useful.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence connects queue delay, placement, utilization, throttling, memory/device pressure, runtime readiness and successful work. Fragmentation, inaccurate requests, quota, topology, cold starts and a saturated downstream service can leave capacity apparently free while latency and pending work grow.

#### Non-GitOps deployment to Argo CD

**What it is.** The term Non-GitOps deployment to Argo CD is a delivery mechanism that binds reviewed source to an immutable revision and moves that revision through validation and bounded rollout toward verified runtime state within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Treat delivery like a controlled assembly line: reviewed source becomes an immutable artifact, the artifact is promoted without being rebuilt, and each environment records exactly which revision is effective.

**How it works.** The lifecycle begins with versioned intent, validates syntax and policy, resolves dependencies, builds or selects immutable inputs, produces a diff or release plan, changes the target in bounded waves, and records status. Reconciliation keeps desired and observed state aligned; rollback is another tested state transition, not merely a command name.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence links source revision, review, test, artifact digest, signer/provenance, deployment target and user-facing verification. Mutable tags, environment-specific rebuilds, unpinned dependencies, non-idempotent migrations and controllers fighting emergency changes are recurring failure modes.

#### Non-observable AI application to OpenTelemetry

**What it is.** The term Non-observable AI application to OpenTelemetry is an observability signal that records a defined aspect of runtime behavior; its schema, context, sampling, retention and query semantics determine which hypotheses it can distinguish within Migration scenarios.

**Junior mental model.** Telemetry is the instrument panel, not the system itself. Metrics summarize trends, logs preserve discrete context, traces connect work across boundaries, profiles attribute resource use, and audit events record security-relevant actions.

**How it works.** Instrumentation observes a defined event or state, attaches bounded context, transports the signal, stores it under retention rules and makes it queryable. A useful signal has documented semantics and can distinguish at least two competing explanations; correlation identifiers belong in logs or traces rather than unbounded metric labels.

**What it looks like in production.** Healthy evidence includes coverage of the user journey, known collection delay and actionable SLO or saturation views. Missing telemetry, sampling bias, cardinality explosions, sensitive payload capture and alert thresholds disconnected from user impact are failures of the observability system itself.

### Worked command and configuration example

The following is a diagnostic example, not an unexplained command dump. Define every uppercase placeholder first—for example `NAME`, `RESOURCE`, `PROJECT`, `REGION`, `NAMESPACE`, `URL`, `IMAGE` or `CONTAINER`—and use a sandbox or read-only production role.

```bash
date -u; whoami; hostname
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
terraform plan
git log --since='2 hours ago' --oneline
```

What the example demonstrates:

- `date -u; whoami; hostname` captures a read-oriented state snapshot that must be interpreted against a healthy baseline, the exact target and the next adjacent dependency.
- `kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp` reads Kubernetes API desired/status state or recent reconciliation evidence without treating a single `Ready` value as proof of the user journey.
- `terraform plan` checks configuration or previews the dependency-aware state transition before any apply; the preview must be reviewed for replacement, deletion, identity and cost.
- `git log --since='2 hours ago' --oneline` inspects the repository's object graph, refs or diff so a delivery decision is tied to exact content rather than an assumed branch name.

A healthy run returns the intended identity/context, exits successfully and shows the expected object or response without a new warning, retry loop or saturation signal. A failure is useful evidence: preserve the exact exit code, status/reason, timestamp and target, then inspect the immediately adjacent layer before changing anything. This makes the example part of the explanation of **Migration scenarios**, not merely a list to copy.

### Security, reliability and production ownership

Security controls who can initiate a transition and what data or resource that transition may affect. Authentication, authorization, network reachability, encryption and audit solve different problems and must align at each boundary. Short-lived attributable identities, least privilege, explicit tenant separation and tested key/certificate rotation reduce blast radius. Logs and traces need their own data controls because copying a secret or customer payload into telemetry defeats the primary protection.

Reliability depends on every synchronous dependency and on the eventual convergence of asynchronous work. Timeouts bound waiting; idempotency makes an ambiguous retry safe; backpressure and load shedding keep demand within useful capacity; replication and failover help only across independent failure domains. Recovery must be tested from protected state and verified through the original user outcome, not inferred from a green administrative status.

Ownership makes these mechanisms operable. Every production resource or service needs an accountable team, source-of-truth revision, environment and data classification, SLO, runbook, cost center and retirement policy. Reversible mitigation can stabilize an incident, but the durable repair belongs in Git, IaC, policy or the owning application so reconciliation does not reintroduce the fault.

### Observability, performance and cost

Metrics, logs, traces, profiles and audit events are complementary. A useful diagnostic path starts with time, identity, exact target and user symptom, then compares desired and observed state before moving through reconciliation, network/protocol, runtime, dependency and saturation layers. High-cardinality request or object IDs belong in sampled logs or traces rather than metric labels; alerts should represent actionable user-impact risk or leading exhaustion.

Performance is governed by work distribution, queueing and bottlenecks. Rate, latency percentiles, errors, saturation, queue depth or age and service-specific limits reveal more than average utilization. Application replicas and underlying machines, storage or provider quota scale through separate loops with different cold delays. Cost includes idle headroom, requests or work units, storage/retention, network transfer, telemetry, support and recovery capacity; optimize cost per successful outcome rather than the cheapest isolated resource.

## Practice

### Practice objective

Build a small, safe proof of **Migration scenarios** and explain the result in your own words. The goal is not command completion; it is to connect input, internal mechanism, observable state and user outcome.

### Prerequisites and setup

Use a disposable local or cloud sandbox. Confirm identity/context and cost boundary, capture a healthy baseline with the commands above, introduce one bounded configuration or invalid-input failure, compare evidence, revert from source control, verify the original outcome, and delete only the named lab resources.

Record tool and platform versions because flags, APIs and defaults can change. Define every uppercase placeholder before use and keep secrets out of shell history and committed files.

### Activity 1: establish a healthy baseline

Run the read-oriented example first:

```bash
date -u; whoami; hostname
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
terraform plan
git log --since='2 hours ago' --oneline
```

For each line, write down the layer it inspects, the expected healthy field or response, and one thing it cannot prove. The expected result is an attributable request against the intended target plus enough state to draw the path from input to outcome.

### Activity 2: create or review the smallest working example

Put the smallest relevant command, configuration, manifest or code sample in source control. Validate or lint it, produce a preview/diff where the tool supports one, and apply only inside the disposable boundary. Record the exact revision and resulting resource or process ID. If the topic is observational rather than configurable, save a sanitized baseline and an automated assertion instead of mutating the system.

### Activity 3: controlled failure and troubleshooting

Introduce one bounded failure: use a definitely nonexistent resource name, an invalid sandbox-only value, a denied test identity, a closed test port or a stopped disposable dependency. Capture the exact error and classify it as identity/policy, input/configuration, control-plane reconciliation, network/protocol, dependency or capacity. Test one discriminating hypothesis at a time; do not widen access or restart unrelated components.

Expected failure evidence is a specific non-zero exit, status/reason, event or protocol response that disappears when the controlled fault is removed. If healthy and failing runs look identical, the chosen signal does not explain the phenomenon and the exercise is not complete.

### Verification

Repeat the original client or user-facing check, not only an administrative status command. Confirm the desired revision, data correctness where applicable, error and latency recovery, and absence of a continuing retry/backlog/saturation condition. Explain why this evidence proves recovery and what uncertainty remains.

### Cleanup and rollback

Revert the configuration in its source of truth and review the rollback diff before applying it. Delete only the named sandbox resources, stop disposable processes, remove temporary credentials and verify that no billable resource, volume, artifact, queue item or background job remains. Read-only activities require no infrastructure rollback, but sanitized captures must still follow retention policy.

### Harder extension

Automate the healthy and failing paths in CI, use short-lived identity, add one SLI/alert or policy assertion, and write a five-step runbook another engineer can execute without hidden context. Then explain how the design changes for two tenants, a zonal or dependency failure, 10× load and a strict cost or recovery target.
