## Senior — procedural incident, migration and ownership questions

### LOAD-BALANCING-SP-01

- [ ] **Incident/migration:** **Question:** You own a high-severity failure or migration involving Layer 4 versus Layer 7. How do you lead it end to end?

**Answer:** Establish incident/change command, impact, decision rights, communications cadence and abort criteria. Preserve evidence and use `ip -br addr; ip route; ip neigh` as one read-only checkpoint, not the whole diagnosis. is a design comparison: define both sides, contrast mechanism and guarantees, then select using workload, failure, security, ownership and cost evidence rather than preference. Choose reversible containment, protect tenant/data boundaries, and keep rollback artifacts/state. Recover in waves and validate SLO, correctness/quality, security and billing.

## Self-grading

A complete spoken answer names the mechanism, scope/assumptions, one concrete command or configuration field, a failure mode, security/recovery, an SLI and a cost/trade-off. For procedural answers, explicitly separate immediate reversible mitigation from durable source-of-truth repair.
